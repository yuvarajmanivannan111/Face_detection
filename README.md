Face Detection with OpenCV! ğŸš€ 
Today, I dived into the world of computer vision and explored how to detect faces in images using Python and OpenCV.
What I did:
ğŸ”¹ Used Haar Cascades to detect faces in an image.
ğŸ”¹ Loaded an image and converted it to grayscale for better accuracy.
ğŸ”¹ Applied the face detection model to draw rectangles around detected faces.
Key Takeaways:
ğŸ”¹ Learned how image processing can be leveraged for real-time applications.
ğŸ”¹ Explored the importance of using grayscale images for face detection.
ğŸ”¹ Practiced handling images and displaying outputs using OpenCV
